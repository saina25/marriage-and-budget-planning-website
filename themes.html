            <h1 class = "themes">1. Nawabi Andaaz – The Lucknowi Theme</h1>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/36/6d/4c366d1ea223089cc6ba2b8d8b230694.jpg" alt="lucknowi theme">
            <p>The Nawabs of Lucknow were known for their rich artistic taste and a deep sense of aesthetics. They had the reputation of being among the greatest admirers of art and culture in dynastic India so much so that a number of them were famous poets and writers themselves. Unlike the Mughals who were known for their extravagance, the Nawabs of Lucknow preferred to be remembered for their aristocracy and sober taste. It is no wonder, therefore, that one of the sweetest and most polite languages in the world, Urdu, originated and flourished under the patronization and supervision of the Nawabs. Use this aristocracy and rich cultural heritage as a theme for your dream wedding. Bring in the ghazal, shayari or thumri artists for a memorable live performance in the evening at your reception. Decorate the whole place in Lucknowi style with huge paintings, crystal chandeliers and cutouts of Urdu poems. Make Chikankari and churidaar part of your wedding dress. Include shayaris in the invitation cards as well as the menu cards, and welcome every guest with a rose. Include a variety of kebabs in the starters as well as the main course. And, of course, don’t forget to add the world-famous Awadhi Biryani to your flavourful wedding menu. </p>

            <h1 class ="themes">2. Rajasthan ki Shaan – The Royal Rajputana Theme </h1>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1c/22/fa/1c22fa4fa5b25fd136e69a835d096e90.jpg" alt="Rajasthani theme">
            <p>Bask in the glory of Rajputana. Choose the royal theme for your wedding. Decorate the whole place like a fort palace with swords, knives, javelins and shields or book a heritage royal property as a venue for your wedding. Wear Rajasthani Kundan choker necklace, Kangan and Kada, Borla and Kundan butti as wedding jewellery. Use bright and vibrant colors in the drapes, curtains and mandap decorations. Arrange for live dance performances by Rajasthani folk artists. Include Laal maas, Jungli maas, Kair sangri and Gatthe ki sabji in the menu. Don’t forget to include Ghewar in the desert.</p>

            <h1 class="themes">3. Old World Charm – The Vintage Theme</h1>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/d0/23/b0d023343cef58cdeadc262f35ec9931.jpg" alt="Vintage">
            <p>Relish the days of the British Raj with this historical theme. Make long gowns and suits with bow ties part of your wedding dresses. Wear a Victorian hat with a red ribbon on your head. The jewelry should be antique and traditional. Let the groom arrive in a classic vintage car. Let there be old-fashioned and neatly attired chhatradharis to escort the groom to the mandap. Instead of walking to the mandap, you can ride a palanquin. Go to your sasural on a horse-pulled fiton car. Food should be served on metal plates or gold-rimmed china. Wine is a must on the drinks menu.</p>

            <h1 class="themes">4. Filmy Style – The Bollywood Theme</h1>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/7d/4c/5e7d4c1bda197ec1e194327ccca37524.jpg" alt="Bollywood Theme">
            <p>This one is for the cine buffs and the diehard fans of Bollywood. Easy to emulate, this theme can really turn your wedding party into an evening full of excitement and fun. Get large movie posters and banners printed, and paste them on the walls of the banquet hall or the wedding hall. Construct an artificial temple beside the mandap, and get married in true Bollywood style in front of that makeshift temple. Create as much drama as possible. Imitate a 70s hairdo with parted fringes on both sides of the forehead. Gift your friends polka-dotted kameez and large collared shirts, and ask them to wear the same to the party in Vinod Khanna and Zeenat Aman style. Hire local singers and tell them to sing “Yaadon ki baraat” from the elevated stage wearing bell-bottom pants and oversized sunglasses. Install large life-like cutouts of Bollywood superstars and megastars and put garlands on them.</p>

            <h1 class="themes">5. The Vegas Casino Theme</h1>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/21/d4/aa21d4a7dfa96108fc9ec4b85de32329.jpg" alt="Vegas Casino Theme">
            <p>This can be a great idea for wedding receptions. People come to the wedding reception to enjoy themselves, eat food and have lots of fun. So, give them something to cheer about. Instead of boring them with the same old live music and DJ that they are greeted with at every other party, surprise them with some exciting poker games like the ones found in casinos. Make the decoration as real as possible and the games as genuine as the original ones. Introduce some gifts or nominal cash prizes for the winners. Poker games have hundreds of varieties. Talk to your wedding organizer and try to arrange for 3-4 games each for every age group. For children, you can install video game kiosks. Wear sequined gowns and suits to match the glamorous theme. Hire a professional anchor to create excitement and announce the outcomes of the games played. Open a large bottle of champagne to celebrate the winning game. Also, if it is possible, you can install a musical fountain in the middle of the lawn in line with the famous dancing fountains in front of the Hotel Bellagio in Vegas.</p>
